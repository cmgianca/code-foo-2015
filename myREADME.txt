This is just here to quickly explain how to run each of my solutions:

My answer to question 2 is predictably in the "question_2" file.

My solution to question 3 was done in java, so the "WordSearch.java" file has
to be compiled and run. The program takes no input arguments, but assumes that
word-search.txt lies in the same directory. If all works as it should, an image
showing each of the word locations should pop up.

My combined solution to questions 4 and 5 is in the IGN_app_files directory.
All that needs to be done is the a.htm file needs to be a run in a browser.
It was made specifically in firefox, but seems to work fine in chrome except
for one minor graphical inconsistency. Other browsers have not been tested.
