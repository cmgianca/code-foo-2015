To apply to Code-Foo 2015, fork this repository and answer all questions. Push your answers to your fork and send us an email at ign_code-foo@ign.com to let us know you're finished.

IGN's Code-Foo 2015 is open to US residents only.  All answers must be completed using Java, Scala, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C, or JavaScript. Application must be turned in by _Friday, May 1st at 5pm PST_. You will be notified by email if you pass the first round of submissions.

1. Create a 2-5 minute video introducing yourself and tell us why we should choose you for the Code-Foo program.

2. How many ping-pong balls can you fit in 747? Describe each step in your thought process.

3. Write a program to find the given words from the included word search. Both word search and words can be found at [word-search.txt] (https://github.com/ign/code-foo-2015/blob/master/word-search.txt)

  I decided to write this program in java, since that was the language I feel most comfortable with at the moment. To run the program, simply compile and run WordSearch.java. It takes no command line arguments, but makes the assumption that word-search.txt is in the same directory, in order to parse the data and come up with a solution. If it all works, a window should appear with a graphic showing the location of every word in the puzzle. 

4.  Using [this API] (http://ign-apis.herokuapp.com), pull and display a list of both articles and videos.

  Goto question 5:

5. Using the results from the previous question, create a web/ios/android application that displays the results and matches [this design] (https://github.com/ign/code-foo-2015/blob/master/design.png). The application should be responsive to common screen/device sizes.

  My application was made through a combination of html, css and javascript. To open and use the application, go into the "IGN_app_files" directory and simply run "a.htm" in a browser. The program was made for firefox, but seems to work fine in chrome aside from one minor graphical inconsistency.
